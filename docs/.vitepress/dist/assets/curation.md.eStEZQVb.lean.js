This data ranged from supplimentary material from published papers to well curated databases under open licenses. It was decided by the Steering Committee that the focus of COCONUT Natural Products database was to provide reliable information on Molecules, Organisms and sample locations within the organisms where these molecules were reported from, and geo-locations where these organisms were reported to be found in literature. In order provide this complete set of information on a compound, wherever it was determined during the curation process that the required information was missing webscraping was utilised.

Initially data from each collection is passed through RDKit pipeline. Any molecules that failed to get parsed by RDKit were eliminated from further processing. The parsed molecules were then kept as CSV files with all the data provided by the sources. These CSV files are then loaded into COCONUT database preserving the data to trace it back the source. Now, to establish that the chemical structure are valid, ChEMBL pipeline (ChEMBL Structure Curation Pipeline Checker) was used. Any molecules marked with an error code of 6 or higer are marked as rejected and kept for future reference (COCONUT provides tools to make corrections at this stage to rectify any discrepancies that led to these errors and resubmit the molecules).
