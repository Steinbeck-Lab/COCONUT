The search engine will identify compounds that contain the inputted name in their title.</p></li><li><p><strong>InChI Search:</strong> The InChI is a non-proprietary identifier for chemical substances that are widely used in electronic data sources. It expresses chemical structures in terms of atomic connectivity, tautomeric state, isotopes, stereochemistry, and electronic charge to produce a string of machine-readable characters unique to the particular molecule.</p></li><li><p><strong>InChI-Key Search:</strong> The InChI-Key is a 25-character hashed version of the full InChI, designed to allow for easy web searches of chemical compounds. InChIKeys consist of 14 characters resulting from a hash of the connectivity information, followed by a hyphen, 8 characters from a hash of the remaining layers, a version indicator, and a checksum character.</p></li><li><p><strong>Molecular Formula Search:</strong> The molecular formula shows the kinds of atoms and the number of each kind in a single molecule of a particular compound. By entering a molecular formula, the software will output a group of compounds with the specified atoms and their numbers within a single molecule.</p></li><li><p><strong>COCONUT ID Search:</strong> Each natural product in our database is assigned a unique COCONUT ID, which can be used for quick and precise searches exclusively on COCONUT.</p></li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Search Tip</p><p>When using the InChI, InChI-Key, or Molecular Formula search, be sure to enter the exact string for the most accurate results.</p></div>',11),c=[s];function l(h,u,d,m,p,f){return t(),a("div",null,c)}const _=o(i,[["render",l]]);export{C as __pageData,_ as default};
