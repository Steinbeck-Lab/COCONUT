COCONUT allows careful storage of the details of the source of the collections so as to ensure traceabitlity and authenticity of the data on the NPs.</p><p>COCONUT has NP data from 63 sources (as of sept 2024) ranging from supplimentray resources to well curated databases. Despite the well curation efforts of these sources, the same compound from multiple source still has discrepancies that lead to confusion. To mitigate and resolve these discrepancies, COCONUT allows for live curation of compounds, organisms and sample locations from where the compounds were reported to be found and geo locations where these organisms were reported.</p><p>For a compound to be considered to be of natural origin, it should be reported to be found in an organism with a citable DOI. Veriety of ways are made available to the users to report synthetic compounds or suggest changes in data discrepancies of the NPs on the COCONUT DB.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">New Collection or Compound submission</p><p>Any collection submitted to COCONUT will be given its own DOI to enable citation of the collection.
