##

In the field of drug discovery and development, Natural Products have long been known to be a treasury of biologically active comopunds which are at the base of many therapeutic agents. However there are challenges in accessing and using this data. While there are numerous sources that supply data on Natural Products, often DBs face the challenges of remaining online and with active maintenance. The data that is available on a compound may display variations across multiple sources. Since different databases store different set of information related to a compound, the data from one DB may become incompatible with data from a different DB. And finally, lies the hurdle of searching for licenses in using the available data, which again vary from source to source leading to an atomosphere of confusion in the community of releasechers. It is in background of the above challenges, the original 2021 version of COCONUT was built. As the NPs' data grew in volume and complexity, the need for a platform that can address the challenges of scalability of the DB, while at the same time, capable of meeting the evolving demands of the scientific community arose. 2024 COCONUT was released to fullfill these necessities of the researchers.

[COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT)](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net) is an open source, FAIR principles adhering, collaborative platform for aggregation and curation of data on Natural Products. The Original 2021 version of COCONUT aggregated data from 53 open Natural Product Collections which is now increased to 63 in the latest 2024 release. This revamped platform also goes beyond the vision of the Original by providing tools to leverage community collaborations in curation of the data so as to empower researches with reliable information on Natural Products thereby enhancing the research ecosystem in this field. In order to ensure accountability and tranparency in the curation process which aims at providing reliable data, the platform also maintains extensive audit trails on who did what and when. To summarise, the 2024 release of the platform not only boasts a larger collection of Natural Products but also enhanced capabilities to ensure the data is of high quality.




<!-- [COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT)](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net) is an aggregated dataset comprising elucidated and predicted natural products (NPs) sourced from open repositories. It offers a user-friendly web interface for browsing, searching, and efficiently downloading NPs. The latest database integrates more than 63 open NP resources, providing unrestricted access to data free of charge. Each entry in the database represents a "flat" NP structure, accompanied by information on its known stereochemical forms, relevant literature, producing organisms, natural geographical distribution, and [precomputed](https://api.naturalproducts.net/docs) molecular properties.  -->


::: tip What are Natural Products?
Natural products are small bioactive molecules produced by living organisms with potential applications in pharmacology and various industries. COCONUT facilitates NP research, enabling computational screening and other in-silico applications.
