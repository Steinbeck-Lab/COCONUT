## Molecule Search Functionality

Our advanced molecule search engine provides a robust set of features for users to search for and identify chemical compounds through various methods. Below is a detailed overview of the search functionalities available.

### Simple Search
- **Molecule Name:** Users can search for molecules by entering any widely recognized name, such as IUPAC, trivial, or synonym names. The search engine will identify compounds that contain the inputted name in their title.

### InChI-IUPAC (International Chemical Identifier)
- **InChI Search:** The InChI is a non-proprietary identifier for chemical substances that is widely used in electronic data sources. It expresses chemical structures in terms of atomic connectivity, tautomeric state, isotopes, stereochemistry, and electronic charge in order to produce a string of machine-readable characters unique to the particular molecule. Therefore, when InChl name is entered, the software output will be a unique inputted compound with all required characteristics.

### InChIKey Search
- **InChIKey:** The InChIKey is a 25-character hashed version of the full InChI, designed to allow for easy web searches of chemical compounds. InChIKeys consist of 14 characters resulting from a hash of the connectivity information from the full InChI string, followed by a hyphen, followed by 8 characters resulting from a hash of the remaining layers of the InChI, followed by a single character indicating the version of InChI used, followed by single checksum character. Therefore, when the user enters the InChl key, the software output will be a single compound that is recognized by a particular InChl key.

### Molecular Formula Search
- **Molecular Formula:** The molecular formula is a type of chemical formula that shows the kinds of atoms and the number of each kind in a single molecule of a particular compound. The molecular formula doesnâ€™t show any information about the molecule structure. The structures and characteristics of compounds with the same molecular formula may vary significantly. Hence, by entering a molecular formula into the search bar, the software output will be a group of compounds with specified atoms and their numbers within a single molecule.

### Coconut ID
- **Unique Identifier:** Each natural product in our database is assigned a unique Coconut ID, which can be used for quick and precise searches exclusively on COCONUT.
