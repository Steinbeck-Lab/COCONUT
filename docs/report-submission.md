3. On the right pane, beneath the compound images, click **"Report this compound."**
4. Log in if prompted.
5. Complete the **"Create Report"** form:
   - **Title:** Provide a concise title summarizing the issue.
   - **Evidence/Comment:** Offer evidence or comments supporting your observation of the discrepancy.
   - **URL:** Include any relevant links to substantiate your report.
   - **Molecules:** This field will be pre-filled with the compound identifier.
   - **Tags:** Add comma-separated keywords to facilitate easy search and categorization of your report.
6. Click **"Create"** to submit your report.

### 2. Reporting from the Reports Page

You can report one or more compounds from the Reports page:

4. Complete the **"Create Report"** form:
   - **Report Type:** Select **"Molecule."**
   - **Title:** Provide a concise title summarizing the issue.
   - **Evidence/Comment:** Offer evidence or comments supporting your observation of the discrepancy.
   - **URL:** Include any relevant links to substantiate your report.
   - **Molecules:** The select option is currently unavailable. Instead, provide the identifiers of the molecules, separated by commas (e.g., `CNP0335993,CNP0335993`).
   - **Tags:** Add comma-separated keywords to facilitate easy search and categorization of your report.
5. Click **"Create"** to submit your report, or **"Create & create another"** if you have additional reports to submit.
