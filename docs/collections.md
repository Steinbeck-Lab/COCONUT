# Collections

A collection is a set of compounds reported in a published work having a citable DOI and the data covered under an open source license. COCONUT allows careful storage of the details of the source of the collections so as to ensure traceabitlity and authenticity of the data on the NPs.

COCONUT has NP data from 63 sources (as of sept 2024) ranging from supplimentray resources to well curated databases. Despite the well curation efforts of these sources, the same compound from multiple source still has discrepancies that lead to confusion. To mitigate and resolve these discrepancies, COCONUT allows for live curation of compounds, organisms and sample locations from where the compounds were reported to be found and geo locations where these organisms were reported. 

For a compound to be considered to be of natural origin, it should be reported to be found in an organism with a citable DOI. Veriety of ways are made available to the users to report synthetic compounds or suggest changes in data discrepancies of the NPs on the COCONUT DB.

::: info New Collection or Compound submission
Any collection submitted to COCONUT will be given its own DOI to enable citation of the collection. Also, to submit a collection of compounds or an individial compound, each compound should be cited in a publication along with the organism details (if possible, the part of the organism - sample location) should be provided.

>To submit a new collection, please send your natural product data in CSV format to the COCONUT database by emailing [info.coconut@uni-jena.de](mailto:info.coconut@uni-jena.de).

**OR**

>To submit them on your own to the COCONUT platform, follow the instructions [here](/collection-submission).
