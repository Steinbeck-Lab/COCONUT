                                COCONUT Online is an open-source project that stores,
                                searches, and analyzes Natural Products (NPs). The
                                database contains over 50 open NP resources, and the
                                data is accessible free of charge and without any
                                restrictions. Each entry corresponds to a "flat" NP
                                structure and is associated with their known
                                stereochemical forms, literature, organisms that produce
                                them, natural geographic presence, and precomputed

                                        Compounds of interest can be explored in a
                                        straightforward and practical manner. There is
                                        often difficulty in naming compounds
                                        appropriately due to the large number of
                                        functional groups present. Structure search is
                                        therefore a great method of discovering all the
                                        properties of a compound simply by providing its
                                        visual representation. InChl and Canonical

                                            The Ullmann algorithm is a backtracking
                                            procedure that utilizes a relaxation-based
                                            reï¬nement step to reduce the search space.
                                            The refinement is the most important step of
                                            the algorithm. It basically evaluates the
                                            surrounding of every node in the database
                                            molecules and compares them with the entered
                                            substructure.

                                            The DF algorithm executes the search
                                            operation of the entered molecule in a
                                            depth-first manner (bond by bond).
                                            Therefore, this algorithm utilizes
                                            backtracking search iterating over the bonds
                                            of entered molecules.

                                            The Vento-Foggia algorithm iteratively
                                            extends a partial solution using a set of
                                            feasibility criteria to decide whether to
                                            extend or backtrack. In the Ullmann
                                            algorithm, the node-atom mapping is fixed in
                                            every step. In contrast, the Vento-Foggia
                                            algorithm iteratively adds node-atom pairs
                                            to a current solution. In that way, this
                                            algorithm directly discovers the topology of
                                            the substructure and seeks for all natural
                                            products that contain the entered

                                    molecules that are computed by algorithms. The
                                    numerical values of molecular descriptors are used
                                    to quantitatively express the physical and chemical

                                        a chemical data file format developed by MDL. In
                                        this type of format, the natural products are
                                        delimited by lines consisting of four dollar
                                        signs ($$$$). All associated data items are
                                        denoted for every natural product in the
                                        database.
